Cruncher is an analytics organization that analyzes popular online gaming platforms to provide their users with insights on 
how to achieve better performance in their gameplay. Cruncher is currently working on an online platform Mobalysis that collects statics 
from the popular MOBA game League of Legends. Cruncher is currently facing the following issues on its Mobalysis platform: 
Roll out of bug fixes and changes to the live platform is currently a manual process and takes too long 
		
Roll out of changes to the live platform is error prone. 
		
Platform outages take too long to recover from 
		
The site frequently goes down whenever there’s a surge in user traffic 
		
We currently only find out there’s a problem with the site when we receive complaints through the customer care department 
	 
The problems cited above are leading to attrition of Cruncher’s user base and as such affecting the business performance. 

Cruncher would like to set up an IT operations team to improve the operation of the platform. 
To address the above issues the IT operations team in collaboration with the Development teams will be required to: 

Review the current deployment architecture and provide recommendations for suitable deployment architectures moving forward. 
	
Set up a production and beta deployment environment as per the architectures identified in the previous step. 
	
Automate deployment of the application to both the production and beta environments 
	
Work with the development team to determine and capture and monitor key application performance metrics 
		
Work with the development team to ensure that the key application components and supporting services are monitored.
